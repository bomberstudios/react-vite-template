# react-vite-template

A minimal React + Vite template, based on the default Vite template for React.

As a bonus, it includes a GitHub Action that deploys the site to GitHub Pages, so you can get your project online with as little fuss as possible.

## Usage

```shell
npx degit bomberstudios/react-vite-template project-name
cd project-name
npm install
npm run dev
```
